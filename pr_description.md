Clarify repository transfer / delegation criteria for personal repositories

PR description:
This PR clarifies the guidance on the "Maintaining ownership continuity of your personal account's repositories" page by:

- Replacing the vague line "You can invite someone to manage your user owned repositories if you are not able to." with a clearer explanation of when repository management or transfer is possible, and that eligibility depends on GitHub policies and verification.
- Adding a new subsection explaining the difference between temporary unavailability (owner alive but unreachable) and permanent unavailability (deceased or legally incapacitated), and the recommended actions for each case.
- Linking and referencing the GitHub Deceased User Policy and repository transfer documentation.
- Including proactive suggestions for repository owners (transfer to an organization, add maintainers, estate planning suggestions) and sample wording for wills or account documentation.

Rationale:
The current page suggests that someone can be "invited to manage" repositories without explaining the practical or legal constraints, which leaves users unsure what to expect in urgent or sensitive situations. This change improves clarity and helps users take pragmatic steps to ensure continuity.

How to review:
- Confirm links point to the correct policy pages.
- Check the wording for tone and legal neutrality.
- Suggest any additional cross-links to GitHub docs (e.g., repository transfer, organizations, collaborators).

Notes:
- This PR is a user-suggested editorial clarification and does not propose policy changes. It simply adds guidance and links to existing GitHub policies.
